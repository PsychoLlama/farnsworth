  <p>A P2P video meeting app.<p>
</div>

## Purpose

Privacy is a human right. Farnsworth makes secure, encrypted 1:1 video calling accessible to everyone.

Features:

- Peer to Peer: Whereever possible, calls happen directly between browsers without a middleman.
- Trustless: Signaling is done through an encrypted tunnel. Not even the signaling server can read your ICE candidates.
- Self-hosted: Easily run your own signaling server.
